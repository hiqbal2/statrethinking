    "In 1980, a typical Bengali woman could have 5 or more children in her lifetime. By the year 200, a typical Bengali woman had only 2 or 3. You’re going to look at a historical set of data, when contraception was widely available but many families chose not to use it. These data reside in data(bangladesh) and come from the 1988 Bangladesh Fertility Survey. Each row is one of 1934 women. There are six variables, but you can focus on three of them for this practice problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `district`: ID number of administrative district each woman resided in\n",
    "1. `use.contraception`: An indicator (0/1) of whether the woman was using contraception\n",
    "1. `urban`: An indicator (0/1) of whether the woman lived in a city, as opposed to living in a rural area\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is ensure that the cluster variable, district, is a contiguous set of integers. Recall that these values will be index values inside the model. If there are gaps, you’ll have parameters for which there is no data to inform them. Worse, the model probably won’t run. Look at the unique values of the `district` variable:\n",

    "Now, focus on predicting `use.contraception`, clustered by `district_id`. Do not include `urban` just yet. Fit both (1) a traditional fixed-effects model that uses dummy variables for district and (2) a multilevel model with varying intercepts for district. Plot the predicted proportions of women in each district using contraception, for both the fixed-effects model and the varying-effects model. That is, make a plot in which district ID is on the horizontal axis and expected proportion using contraception is on the vertical. Make one plot for each model, or layer them on the same plot, as you prefer. How do the models disagree? Can you explain the pattern of disagreement? In particular, can you explain the most extreme cases of disagreement, both why they happen where they do and why the models reach different inferences?"
