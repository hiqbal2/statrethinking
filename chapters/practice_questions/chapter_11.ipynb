This assumption implies that mortality increases exponentially with a linear increase in storm strength, because a Poisson regression uses a log link. So it’s worth exploring an alternative hypothesis: that the logarithm of storm strength is what matters. Explore this by using the logarithm of damage_norm as a predictor. Using the best model structure from the previous problem, compare a model that uses `log(damage_norm)` to a model that uses `damage_norm` directly. Compare their DIC/WAIC values as well as their implied predictions. What do you conclude?"

The problem is that not everyone tried to fish, so the fish_caught numbers are zero-inflated. As with the monks example in the chapter, there is a process that determines who is fishing (working) and another pro- cess that determines fish per hour (manuscripts per day), conditional on fishing (working). We want to model both. Otherwise we’ll end up with an underestimate of rate of fish extraction from the park.\n",

One thing you must do, however, is use a proper Poisson offset/exposure in the Poisson portion of the zero-inflated model. Then use the `hours` variable to construct the offset. This will adjust the model for the differing amount of time individuals spent in the park."
