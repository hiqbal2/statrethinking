Fit a model with both varying intercepts by `district_id` and varying slopes of `urban` by `district_id`. You are still predicting `use.contraception`. Inspect the correlation between the intercepts and slopes. Can you interpret this correlation, in terms of what it tells you about the pattern of contraceptive use in the sample? It might help to plot the mean (or median) varying effect estimates for both the intercepts and slopes, by district. Then you can visualize the correlation and maybe more easily think through what it means to have a particular correlation. Plotting predicted proportion of women using contraception, with urban women on one axis and rural on the other, might also help."

In a time series, the observations cluster by entities that have continuity through time, such as individuals.
